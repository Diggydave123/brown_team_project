            "question": "True or false? Cybersecurity experts consider hackers bypassing security measures a malicious activity.",
            "options": ["True", "False"],
            "correct_answer": "False",
            "explanation": "A common misconception is that all hackers are attackers, people who subvert security only for malicious purposes. But hackers hack for various reasons, such as discovering how devices work and testing system security. Today, many hackers are ethical hackers, or offensive security researchers. They work with companies to ensure IT systems are safe and secure."

            "question": "You download a game to your computer. But when you open the file, the game doesnâ€™t start. Worse, your computer starts behaving like someone else is controlling it. For example, the cursor moves by itself and clicks items on the screen. What type of malware might be causing these issues?",
            "options": ["Trojan", "Ransomware", "Virus", "Worm"],
            "correct_answer": "Trojan",
            "explanation": "The game file is probably a trojan. A trojan is a seemingly helpful program designed to secretly give attackers access to the device. Attackers disguise trojans as benign programs or files such as games. Once you run the trojan, the attacker can perform malicious actions such as controlling your computer remotely."
